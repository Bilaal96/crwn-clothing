## Concepts Explored | _What I Learned_

### Frontend - _How to:_

-   create **reusable & composable components** that implement _React Hooks_
-   implement custom, **responsive CSS** with _Styled Components_ and the **mobile-first** design approach
-   optimise component load-times via **Route-based Code Splitting**; using _React Router Dom, React Suspense & Lazy (with dynamic imports)_
-   **measure performance at the component-level** using _React Devtoolsâ€™ Profiler tab_
-   **reduce** number of **unnecessary renders** with _React.memo, useMemo & useCallback hooks_
-   use _Redux_ to **maintain a single data store**
-   **memoize Redux selectors**, so that they don't have to repeatedly compute unchanged derived data; via the _Reselect package_
-   **make requests to backend** _Node API_ (built for Stripe Payments)

### Backend - _How to:_

-   **store & retrieve data in a NoSQL database**; using _Firebase's real-time Firestore database_
-   implement **user authentication** with _Firebase SDK_
-   **build a simple _Node.js & Express API_** (which utilises _environment variables & middleware_) to handle Stripe Payments
-   **host an app** on the _Heroku_ platform
